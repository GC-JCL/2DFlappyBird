2D Flappy Bird: IoT Edition

**Overview**

Welcome to **Flappy Bird: IoT Edition!** This is an improved version of the popular 2D arcade game "Flappy Bird," specially tailored for our Level 3 Cybersecurity Course project. Herein is a small project, which integrates IoT devices into gaming. To indulge in immersive interaction, control the bird with IoT sensors.

**Features**

- Classic Flappy Bird Game-play: Exciting and addictive game-play in which the player gets to guide their bird through obstacles by tapping or via motion. 
- Integration with IoT: This will make it possible for players to control their character in the game with the use of IoT sensors, such as motion detectors, pressure pads, or even smart wearables.
- Cybersecurity Concepts: It includes some concepts showing how IoT devices may be under threat and how such threats could be prevented by secure coding.
- Real Time Data: The game captures sensor data in real time and translates it into physical movements within the game.

**Cybersecurity Integration**

Since this is part of the cybersecurity course, this project also focuses on the security of IoT devices:

- Data Encryption: All communication of IoT is encrypted so nobody could tamper or sniff the data.
- Authentication: Devices must authenticate with the game server before sending the data to prevent unauthorized access.
- IoT Threats: Applies common IoT vulnerabilities, such as weak authentication and lack of encryption, and how they can be mitigated in the game environment.
