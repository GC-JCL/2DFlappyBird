2D Flappy Bird Remastered: IoT Edition

Overview

Welcome to **Flappy Bird Remastered: IoT Edition**! This game is an upgraded version of the classic 2D arcade-style game "Flappy Bird," designed specifically as a project for our **Level 3 Cybersecurity Course**. This project showcases the integration of **IoT (Internet of Things)** devices with gaming. Players control the bird using IoT sensors, creating an immersive, interactive experience.

Features

- **Classic Flappy Bird Gameplay**: A familiar and addictive experience where the player guides the bird through obstacles by tapping or using motion.
- **IoT Integration**: Control the game using IoT sensors such as motion detectors, pressure pads, or even smart wearables. 
- **Cybersecurity Concepts**: The game includes elements demonstrating how IoT devices can be vulnerable to threats and how to protect them through secure coding practices.
- **Real-Time Data**: The game captures sensor data in real-time, translating physical movements into in-game actions.

Cybersecurity Integration

Since this project is part of a cybersecurity course, it also emphasizes the importance of **securing IoT devices**:

- **Data Encryption**: All IoT communication is encrypted to prevent tampering and eavesdropping.
- **Authentication**: Devices must authenticate with the game server before sending data to avoid unauthorized access.
- **IoT Threats**: Demonstrates common IoT vulnerabilities (e.g., weak authentication, lack of encryption) and how they can be mitigated in the game environment.
