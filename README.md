# Flappy Bird
Experimental on raspberry pis! This prototype features a bug where it'll completely trap the entire system with the game, unless you do ctrl+alt+f1 (which opens the game) and quit the game through there. Make sure to do "kill" instead of "exit" or "close". Or you could just restart the system. Hopefully it saved so if the game dont go on fullscreen this means it isnt saved! :P
## Dependence:
* pygame
* sqlite3
